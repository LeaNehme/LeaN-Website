    "text": "I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Epidemiology department, and a T-32 pre-doctoral NIDA fellow. Before joining the PhD program I was working as an interim high school counselor where I witnessed and counseled many students through behavioral health issues including substance misuse and mental health problems. I worked as a lab assistant at the FIU investigative lab which focused on the impact of alcohol during eyewitness testimonies. Additionally, I gained a lot of fast-paced clinical experience surrounding opioids and overdoses when I scribed for the South Miami Hospital ER. This was followed by some more education and training during my time in the Biomedical and Molecular Science Certificate Program with the HWCOM. I earned her Masters in Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology from FIU in the summer of 2021 while simultaneously working for the DOH of West Palm Beach where I was a contact tracer and a contact tracer trainer. This was followed by her investigation of tick borne diseases as well as Salmonella.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nAlcohol and Substance Use/Misuse/Abuse\nMental health\nEmerging adults (18-25 years)\nLatin immigrants\n\nGithub"
